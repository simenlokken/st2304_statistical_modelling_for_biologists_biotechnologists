## Exercise solutions for **ST2304 - Statistical Modelling for Biologists and Biotechnologists at NTNU**

### Information

All exercises and course modules can be found here: **https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/st2304/2024v/start.**

My way of solving these exercises is a "modern" approach by using Tidyverse instead of the classic Base R approach used by the course instructors. Not saying it's better, not saying it's worse, it's just different. It could be a nice transition into different ecosystems in R if that is of interest to some students.

The repo may also contain some modules I have worked through, but these are most likely rather incomplete.

**DISCLAIMER:** There can be (there most likely are) errors in my solutions, so don't use them blindly.
